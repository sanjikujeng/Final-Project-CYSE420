# Final-Project-CYSE420

## Project Overview
This project explores machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches applied to a cybersecurity-related dataset. The objective is to build and compare predictive models, enhance accuracy using ensemble techniques, and conduct a thorough evaluation using key performance metrics.

## Objectives
- Implement at least five ML/DL models.
- Enhance predictive accuracy using ensemble learning methods (e.g., bagging, boosting, stacking).
- Compare the performance of individual models with ensemble approaches.
- Evaluate models using primary metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and additional metrics (precision, recall, AUC-ROC).
