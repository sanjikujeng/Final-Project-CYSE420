# CYSE 420 ML/DL Assignment

This project implements various machine learning and deep learning models for cybersecurity data classification using the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Neural Network
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Place the dataset (`KDDTrain+.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
4. Run `main.py` to train and evaluate models.

## Results
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC) for each model.
- Model comparison and analysis.
